Description: Provides the facility to perform the chi-square and G-square test of independence, calculates the power of the traditional chi-square test, compute permutation and Monte Carlo p-value, and provides measures of association such as Phi, odds ratio with 95 percent CI and p-value, adjusted contingency coefficient, Cramer's V and 95 percent CI, bias-corrected Cramer's V, W, Cohen's w, Goodman-Kruskal's lambda, gamma and its p-value, and tau, Cohen's k and its 95 percent CI. It also calculates standardized, moment-corrected standardized, and adjusted standardized residuals, and their significance. Different outputs are returned in nicely formatted tables.

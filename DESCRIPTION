Description: Provides the facility to perform the chi-square and G-square test of independence, calculates the power of the traditional chi-square test, compute permutation and Monte Carlo p-value, and provides measures of association for tables of any size such as Phi, Phi corrected, odds ratio with 95 percent CI and p-value, Yule' Q and Y, adjusted contingency coefficient, Cramer's V, V corrected, V standardised, bias-corrected V, W, Cohen's w, Goodman-Kruskal's lambda, and tau. It also calculates standardised, moment-corrected standardised, and adjusted standardised residuals, and their significance, as well as the Quetelet Index, IJ association factor, and adjusted standardised counts. It also computes the chi-square-maximising version of the input table. Different outputs are returned in nicely formatted tables.

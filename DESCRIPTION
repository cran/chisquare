Description: Provides the facility to perform the chi-square and G-square test of independence, calculates permutation-based p value, and provides measures of association such as Phi, odds ratio with 95 percent CI and p value, adjusted contingency coefficient, Cramer's V, bias-corrected Cramer's V, Cohen's w, Goodman-Kruskal's lambda, gamma, and tau, Cohen's k. It also calculates standardized and adjusted standardized residuals, and their significance. Different outputs are returned in nicely formatted tables.
